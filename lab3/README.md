# Lab3 Implementation details

- As [this](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3618) issue suggests, you need to:
	`sbt run` the GDELTProducer twice for it to work!
- Implemented the true-stream count updater! 
- To run the visualizer clone and start from [here](https://github.com/Tclv/SBD-2018/tree/master/visualizer/ass3)
- Then start the GDELTProducer
- Also start the GDELTConsumer
- Finally start the GDELTStream
